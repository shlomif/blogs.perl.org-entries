<h1>Introduction to blogs.perl.org + Text::Table</h1>

<p>
Hello, Perl bloggers! I decided to start 
blogging about a most of my exclusively Perl-related stuff here on 
blogs.perl.org, in hope of getting more comments 
from active Perlers. (Until now, I've blogged about it 
<a href="http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/">on
my technical LiveJournal blog</a> and previously on 
<a href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/">use.perl.org Journal</a>.).
You can learn more about me on <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my home 
site - www.shlomifish.org</a> .
</p>

<p>
OK, having put that aside - let's move on to the main topic of this post.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
Many months ago I wanted to use the
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Text-Table/">Text::Table CPAN module</a>
to present a table related to the meta-scan heuristics construction 
scheme of <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a>. Now,
I wanted to present nicely formatted borders, using the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box-drawing_characters">Unicode 
box-drawing characters</a> (which some people would recall from DOS).
However, I found it difficult to specify the separators in the
rulers properly based on their indices - they were assumed to be the
same globally. As a result, I've written 
<a href="https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=61610">a patch</a>,
and placed the modifications in 
<a href="http://github.com/shlomif/Text-Table">a github repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
The author of Text-Table (ANNO) told me he was working on a new version
of Text-Table, which will contain many improvements. However, I was still
interested in an enhanced version of the old Text-Table codebase with my 
patch, and after talking on <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl">#perl</a>, 
ANNO said I could have co-maint
on Text-Table-1.x and continue to improve it. The new Text-Table will be 
released under a separate namespace - <tt>Text::Table2</tt> or so.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks go to ANNO for agreeing that I further develop Text::Table.
</p>

<p>
Using my git repository, I did many cleanups, like add 
pod.t and pod-coverage.t, tweak the author information, add more strict and
warnings to the file, etc. ANNO 's original licence is 
<a href="http://perlbuzz.com/2009/07/help-end-licensing-under-same-terms-as-perl-itself.html">"Same 
terms as Perl"</a>, but since it is an iffy licensing, I decided that all
further changes will be under the terms of the Public-Domain/X11L/etc.. People
who send me pull requests on github may wish to add their names to the credits
(in the changes or even in the core module) but must not claim copyrights to
their changes.
</p>

<p>
OK, now for some output of the Unicode table:

<p>
Future plans are:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
Convert the remaining test scripts to Test::More.
</li>

<li>
Go over the code and clean it up
</li>

<li>
Add CPAN keywords to the <tt>META.yml</tt>. (Perhaps this will require
defining a Module-Build-based Build.PL file).
</li>

<li>
Add URLs to the <tt>META.ym</tt>l - to the module's homepage, to the github repository, 
etc..
</li>

<li>
Possibly implement some future features.
</li>

<li>
Add some more tests.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
Contributions are naturally welcome, just fork the github repository and send
me a pull request. (Or patches are also OK.)

My name is Shlomi Fish and you can learn more about me from the various
pages of my <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">home site - 
www.shlomifish.org</a> and
from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~shlomif/">my CPAN page</a>. I learnt
Perl in 1996, in order to start working for the now mostly defunct Cortext Web
Design, and then used it to write CGI scripts, and for 
shell-scripts-written-in-Perl, after using DOS and some early versions of
Windows and learning a little GW-BASIC, QBasic, C, what was then C/C++ and 
some 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">Visual 
Basic for Applications</a>. I fell in love with both Perl 5 and
UNIX-like operating systems, and been using them ever since.
